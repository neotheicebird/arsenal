The key to dynamic programming is that if a problem can be expressed as subproblems, and the subproblems are overlapping
then we can solve the problem faster than a `brute force` method.

`DP` is careful, efficient, thought through brute force approach.

[Dice problem](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dice-throw-problem/) is a great article to understand one DP problem.
